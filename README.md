From the 11th till the 23th (2023) we worked on a schoolproject named **Linkup**. Linkup is a platform where you can see all the sites from our previous project, where we had to create a business card. On this site you can see all of our fellow students en their creations. 

Here you can see more about our project https://github.com/Treppord/your-tribe-squad-page/wiki
We also had an investigation about the project. Things like drawings, links and more. https://github.com/Treppord/your-tribe-squad-page/wiki/Schetsen-verzameling-vanaf-Miro
