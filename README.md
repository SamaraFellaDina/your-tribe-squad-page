Welcome to the LinkUp GitHub Wiki! LinkUp is a social platform designed for FDND (Front-End Development) students at HVA (Hogeschool van Amsterdam). It provides a space for students to showcase their GitHub profiles and receive upvotes from their peers. LinkUp aims to foster a sense of community among FDND students and promote collaboration.

## Overview

From the 11th till the 23th (2023) we worked on a schoolproject named **Linkup**. Linkup is a platform where you can see all the sites from our previous project, where we had to create a business card. On this site you can see all of our fellow students en their creations. 

Here you can see more about our project https://github.com/Treppord/your-tribe-squad-page/wiki
